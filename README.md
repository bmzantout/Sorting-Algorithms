# Sorting-Algorithms

This project is focused on observing different Sorting Algorithms, comparing their time complexities, as well as getting a deep understanding of their implementations. The code is written with detailed commenting to ease understanding and modifications.  

## Data Structures and Algorithms Project
## Introduction

This Java project implements different sorting algorithms and measures their time complexity. The implemented algorithms are:

- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

## Usage

To run the project, follow the tasks given in the attached Tasks.pdf file. You can follow the commented code in the repository. You can also modify the sample array of integers by editing the main class. Using arrays of different sizes gives more accurate results when testing. [Tasks.pdf](https://github.com/bmzantout/Sorting-Algorithms/files/11220692/Tasks.pdf)

## Results

The execution time of each algorithm will be printed to the console. Additionally, the "Code Report" shows graphs representing the time complexity of each algorithm as the size of the input array increases.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Please make sure to include tests for any new functionality, and ensure that all existing tests pass before submitting your changes.
